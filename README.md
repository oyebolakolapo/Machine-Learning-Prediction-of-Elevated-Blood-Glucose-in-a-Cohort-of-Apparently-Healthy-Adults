# Machine-Learning-Prediction-of-Elevated-Blood-Glucose-in-a-Cohort-of-Apparently-Healthy-Adults
**Objective**: The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model for predicting elevated blood glucose which is a marker of diabetes. The study collected medical history, clinical screening, oral examination and demographic information of apparently healthy individuals. Such a prediction can be immensely valuable for healthcare professionals in identifying individuals who may be at risk of developing diabetes. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies are also interested in these predictions as they can aid in customer profiling and developing tailored treatment plans.

**Dataset**: The dataset used for this project is the NIH-K43 Community Screening dataset obtained from asymptomatic residents of Ijede Community in Lagos, Nigeria. The dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of clinical, medical and demographic data, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The dataset encompasses several essential features including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), electrocardiography, smoking history, blood glucose level, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol etc.

**Methodology**: In this project, we will focus on comparing the accuracy scores of various models to identify the most effective model for predicting high blood sugar. By leveraging the dataset's predictors, we will construct and evaluate multiple models, each employing different algorithms or techniques. The performance of these models will be assessed based on their accuracy in predicting blood sugar. We will also determine feature importance to predict the most importance correlates of possible diabetes in the population.

**Significance**: The implications of accurately predicting blood sugar level are substantial for both healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies. For healthcare professionals, these predictions can assist in early identification of individuals at risk of diabetes, facilitating the implementation of preventive measures and personalized treatment plans. Pharmaceutical companies can leverage such predictions for customer profiling, enabling targeted marketing efforts and tailored interventions.

**Results**: The key findings show that uric acid is the most important feature associated with elevated blood sugar followed by age, systolic blood pressure and body mass index (BMI). These results, however, should be interpreted with caution. The importance of a feature in a Random Forest model doesn't necessarily mean a casual relationship, and it is specific to this model and this dataset. Other models might find different results if additional features are introduced Furthermore, low importance does not mean that the feature is unimportant for predicting bllod sugar level in general, it could just mean that the feature is not useful in the presence of one or more features. A thorough feature analysis and larger dataset should be considered for a better understanding of the contribution of each feature in the prediction.
